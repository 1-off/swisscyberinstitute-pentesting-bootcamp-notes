```text
auth 	These scripts handle authentication data and attempt to work around the authentication on the target system. Examples include x11-access, ftp-anon, and oracle-enum-users. The exceptions are scripts for brute force attacks.
broadcast 	Scripts in this category output broadcasts to identify any previously unidentified hosts on the local network. The newtargets argument automatically adds any newly discovered hosts to the scanning queue.
brute 	Scripts of this type execute brute force attacks to retrieve the target system's access credentials. Nmap has dozens of such scripts for various protocols, for example, http-brute, oracle-brute, and snmp-brute.
default 	These are standard scripts that are used if you run Nmap with the -sC or -A options.
discovery 	These scripts actively attempt to discover more about the network by, for example, querying public registers, SNMP-capable devices, directory services, etc. Examples include html-title, which captures the title of a website, or smb-enum-shares, which reads Windows shares.
dos 	Scripts from this category can cause denial of service attacks. The reason for this is typically testing for vulnerabilities. The service crashing is more of an undesirable side effect than the objective.
exploit 	These scripts target vulnerabilities.
external 	The scripts in this group send data to external databases and network services. For example, Nmap can query a whois server for more details about the target system.
fuzzer 	These scripts send unexpected or random fields in each packet transmitted to the target system. This technique can be used to identify unexpected or unknown vulnerabilities of the targets. An example of this is dns-fuzz, which confronts a DNS server with unknown requests until the server either crashes or blocks the connection.
intrusive 	These scripts cannot be assigned to the safe category because the risk of the target system crashing is fairly high. The reasons include the use of considerable resources or exploiting existing vulnerabilities. If you cannot assign your own scripts to a specific category, you should at least classify them as safe or intrusive .
malware 	These scripts are used to discover whether the target system is already infected with malware or backdoors. Examples include smtp-strangeport, which checks SMTP servers for intruders, and auth-spoof, which identifies identd spoofing daemons.
safe 	These scripts are considered to be safe and will not cause damage to the targets. However, they can use considerable network bandwidth or other resources. Examples include ssh-hostkey, which queries the SSH key, and html-title, which parses the title of a website.
version 	These script types are extensions of the version detection types, however, they cannot be selected explicitly. They only run if you enable version detection with the -sV option. Examples include skypev2-version, pptp-version, and iax2-version.
vuln 	The last script type tests for specific known vulnerabilities. However, reports are only output if vulnerabilities are actually found.
